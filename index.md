## As our name suggests we are passionate about craft beer and fun.

At Beer n' Play you will find carefully selected craft beers pouring from our 23 taps and a wide range of cans and bottles (including alcohol free alternatives). We always show the best sports on our TV's and have an array of different bar-- and boardgames.

Our menu brings you street food with quality ingredients: traditional Pizza Napolitana made with our incredible sourdough, juicy burgers and handcrafted sausages.

Why aren't you here already?
