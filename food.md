# Eat your heart out

### At Beer n' Play you will find classic street food made with premium ingredients.

We bake our pizza in a genuine Italian oven that can keep an even 450 degrees during the 90-110 seconds it takes for the pizza to be perfectly done. Pizza Napolitana is known for its thick crispy crust, and ours is made from sourdough with Tipo-00 flour. The sauce is made from the famous San Marzano tomatoes, and our mozzarella is DOP Fior D'Agerola.

If you want the ultimate burger we have you covered: Made of 70% prime rib and 30% brisket our burgers are juicy, perfectly done and full of flavors. We think the burger experience is not complete if you can't grab it with your hands and dig in!
