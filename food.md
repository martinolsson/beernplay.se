# Eat your heart out

### At Beer n' Play you will find classic street food made with premium ingredients.

We bake our pizza in a genuine Italian oven that can keep an even 450 degrees during the 90-110 seconds it takes for the pizza to be perfectly done. Pizza Napolitana is known for it's thick crispy crust, and ours is made from sourdough with Tipo-00 flour. The sauce is made from the famous San Marzano tomatoes, and our mozarella is DOP Fior D'Agerola.

If you want the perfect burger we have you covered: juicy, perfectly done and full of flavours. We think the burger experience is not complete if you can't grab the burger with your hands and dig in!

Our hotdogs are hand crafted, seasonal and hand picked by our head chef. You will always find classics and some non-traditional surprising flavours. Add a side order and dip to complete your korv!
