# Eat your heart out

### At Beer n' Play you will find innovative variations of classic street food. Perhaps you crave a Korean Hot Dog, an Asian Caesar Sallad or why not a delicious Bookmaker Toast or a fantastic Pizza Napolitana?

Our pizza chef, who has many years of experience of Pizza Napolitana from Italy, bakes our pizza in a genuine Italian oven that can keep an even 450 degrees during the 90 seconds it takes for the pizza to be perfectly done.
