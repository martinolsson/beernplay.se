We ask our customers to respect social distancing and the new health and safety guidelines:

- Maximum 4 people at the bar.
- Respect the markings on the floor.
- Drinking only while seated. NO WALKING WITH DRINKS, if you want to move to a different table ask the staff to take you drinks to the desired table.
- Keep safe space between different groups or couples, this way you should sit at every other table. The staff will ask you to relocate if groups are too close.
- Wash your hands as frequently as possible.
- Use the alcohol gel provided in the bar to sanitize your hands.
- Pay contactless whenever possible.
- If youâ€™re feeling any symptoms associated with COVID-19 or belong to a risk group we urge you to stay at home and take care.
